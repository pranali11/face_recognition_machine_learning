# face_recognition_machine_learning
Face recognition using Neural Networks.
The proposed system utilizes LBPF face recognizer in build command.
the folders test, and training folders are blank
How to excute the algorithm 
------------------------------------------------- preparing data base------------------------------------------------------------

1] prepare database make training-data folder,add another folder d1, d2, d3, d4,etc in it
2] run the code - database prepare , before running the code change the path in the code.
3] press s for saving it in folder- atleast save 13 images in the folder.
4] similary save another person samples in foler d2.
5] add negative images in another folder d3, get random samples of faces.

------------------------------------------------- Running the face-recognition code---------------------------------------------------
6] add tags in face-Recognition code.
7] testing the algorithm, there is another folder testing-data, add some sample photos in testing folder of the person.
8] change the path for it in the code.



Comments: This will only detect the single person in an image, The accuary can be increased by adding more samples in the folder.
